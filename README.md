This project outlines the development of a sustainable automated plant watering system using an ESP32 microcontroller, a soil moisture sensor, solar panels, and rechargeable batteries. The system continuously monitors the soil moisture levels and triggers a water pump to irrigate plants when necessary. During sunlight hours, the system is powered by solar energy, optimizing energy consumption. When solar power is unavailable, the system automatically switches to battery power, ensuring uninterrupted operation. This eco-friendly and energy-efficient solution is designed to minimize human intervention while maintaining optimal soil moisture for plant health. The project offers a cost-effective and scalable solution, ideal for school or university assignments.
